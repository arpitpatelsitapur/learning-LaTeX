# LaTeX Learning Journey

Welcome to my LaTeX learning journey repository! In this repository, I'll be documenting my progress as I learn LaTeX, a typesetting system commonly used for academic and technical documents.

## About LaTeX

LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is widely used in academia for the production of documents such as scientific articles, research papers, theses, and presentations.

2. **Choose an Editor**: Select a LaTeX editor to write your documents. Some popular options include TeXShop, TeXworks, LaTeXila, and Overleaf.
3. **Learn the Basics**: Familiarize yourself with basic LaTeX syntax for document structure, formatting, and mathematical typesetting. There are plenty of online tutorials and resources available to help you get started.
